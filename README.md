# 🐔 Poultry Disease Classification using Deep Learning

A web-based application built with **Flask** and **PyTorch**, designed to classify poultry diseases from images using a deep learning model. The application supports four classes: **Healthy**, **Coccidiosis**, **Salmonella**, and **Newcastle Disease**.

> 📌 Designed for farmers, researchers, and agriculture technologists to enable early disease detection and improved poultry health management.

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Upload poultry images to detect diseases in real-time
- 🤖 Deep learning model trained using **Transfer Learning**
- 🧠 Supports 4 classes: Healthy, Coccidiosis, Salmonella, Newcastle Disease
- 🌐 Built with Python, Flask, HTML/CSS
- 💾 Model weights managed using **Git LFS** (Large File Storage)
- 📂 Lightweight and modular codebase
- 📱 Designed for future mobile integration

## 🧪 Model Details

* `best.pt`: A PyTorch model (\~128 MB) trained using transfer learning on a poultry disease dataset.
* If you're retraining, update `models/best.pt` accordingly and commit via Git LFS.

## 📌 Git LFS Notice

GitHub enforces a 100MB file limit on regular git objects. This project uses **Git LFS** to store the model (`best.pt`).
Make sure to install and configure Git LFS before cloning or pushing changes:

```bash
git lfs install
git lfs track "*.pt"
```
